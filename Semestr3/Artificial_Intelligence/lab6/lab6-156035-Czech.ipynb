    "An implication with a single atom in the premise is also a Horn clause (e.g., $p\\to q$). Without any issues we may also assume that an implication without *any* atoms in the premise is also a Horn clause. In this, we assume that a disjunction of an empty set is always true and thus an implication with an empty premise is, in fact, an atom specified in its conclusion.\n",

Lets begin with creating the KB `warrior`. In the following we will assume that the squares are identified by their Cartesian coordinates, so the entrance is always at $(0,0)$ and in the sample cave above the pits are located at $(2,0)$ (the bottom pit), $(2, 2)$ (the pit in the middle) and $(3, 3)$ (the pit in the top right corner)."

    "This, of course, is not a Horn clause and therefore cannot be added to our knowledge base. However, not all is lost! Observe that $p\\leftrightarrow q$ is equivalent to $(p\\to q) \\land (q\\to p)$ (in other words: *p if, and only if, q* is equivalent to *if p then q and if q then p*). We can thus rewrite the biconditional as two implications:\n",

    "1. $(pit_{1,0} \\lor pit_{0,1}) \\to breezy_{0,0}$\n",

    "Now lets look on the other one: $breezy_{0,0} \\to (pit_{1,0} \\lor pit_{0,1})$. Here, we can apply another trick. Consider reading of this implication: *If a square is breezy, then there is a pit in one of the directly adjacent squares*. We can easily write its contrapositive: *If there isn't a pit in one of the directly adjacent squares, then a square isn't breezy.*. In the propositional logic it becomes: $\\lnot(pit_{1,0} \\lor pit_{0,1}) \\to \\lnot breezy_{0,0}$.\n",
    "Following with the De Morgan's law we arrive at: $\\lnot pit_{1,0} \\land \\lnot pit_{0,1} \\to \\lnot breezy_{0,0}$ which... still isn't a Horn clause!\n",
    "But we've got another trick up the sleeve: we will call any square that does not contain a pit a flat square, and any square that is not breezy a windless square.\n",

    "5. $flat_{1,0} \\land flat_{0,1} \\to windless_{0,0}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Splendid! But there's still one more thing to handle: currently, a single square can contain a pit and be flat at the same time.\n",
    "To handle this, we introduce a special symbol *inconsistent* which can be inferred only if two variables that are known to be inverses of each other can be proven to be both true at the same time:\n",
    "\n",
    "6. $pit_{1,0} \\land flat_{1,0} \\to inconsistent$\n",
    "7. $breezy_{1,0} \\land windless_{1,0} \\to inconsistent$\n",
